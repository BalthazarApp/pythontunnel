"""Schema-only analytics over the Balthazar v2 session tunnel.

The public API is re-exported lazily (PEP 562 ``__getattr__``) for two reasons:

* **No heavy imports at import time.** ``frames`` needs pandas and ``mcp_server``
  needs the mcp SDK; neither should load merely because someone did
  ``import blt_analytics``. Each name pulls in its module only when first touched.
* **Sibling modules may not exist yet.** This package is built by several agents
  in parallel; ``schema``/``frames``/``publish`` land after this file. A plain
  ``from .schema import ...`` would make the whole package unimportable until then,
  which would block the modules that *are* ready. With lazy lookup, only accessing
  a not-yet-written name fails, and with a clear message.
