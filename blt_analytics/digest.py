"""Build a measurement-free *space digest* from plain records.

This module is **stdlib only** on purpose: it runs both on the Runner (inside the
``space_schema`` tunnel op) and locally (the client's fallback when a Runner is
too old to host it), and the two must agree byte-for-byte. Keeping it free of
pandas/numpy guarantees the same answer in both places and lets the schema tools
import it without pulling in the analytics stack.

What the digest says, and what it withholds
-------------------------------------------
For every device type and every flow it reports *structure*: which dotted param /
input / output paths exist, each path's ``kind`` (number, string, list, matrix,
map, …), how many records cover it, distinct-value *counts* for strings and
bools, and date ranges. It never emits a measurement value — no number, no string
value, no min/max/mean of numbers, and no *data-like* key below a collapsed
``map`` (a map's own keys are only counted; of its entries' keys, only the
*structural* ones — shared by most entries — survive, the rest are counted as
``other_keys``; see ``_map_value_dict``). The only values that appear are
timestamps (date ``first``/``last``),
which §3 of the spec sanctions explicitly, plus schema-ish strings the caller
puts in the records themselves (units, declared-parameter descriptions, type
names). That boundary is what lets a coding agent learn the shape of a space
without ever reading its data.

The structural describer here is a descendant of Planckian's
``describe_structure`` (prompt_plotting/prompt_plot_flow.py): same instinct —
report kind, shape and identifiers, never a leaf value — adapted to merge a
*collection* of records into one field per path and to the kinds this spec names.

``build_digest`` is pure and deterministic: the same input yields a byte-identical
``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)``.
